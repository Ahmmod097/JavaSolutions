# Problem Statement
Suppose, you are starting a small business. So, you need to keep a ledger for all the buys, sells, and
available balance on your account. When you run the program, it will be able to accept
command line inputs. And, will show the result in the command line. When engaging with
the command line, it will give you options to add a product, delete a product, buy a product, sell a product, 
see the list of products and check available balance.

# Proposed Solutions
I used two classes. Here the Product class is used to keep all the product attributes and operations what we
can do on a product as methods. We keep all the variables private in Product class in order to achieve encapsulation.
Ledger is our main class. Here users can create as many Product object they want and perform their desired operations as many times as they want.
I use diffrent conditional block to perform these opeartions.  


# To Run:
 
    1. Open command prompt or terminal.
    2. Type 'javac Ledger.java' and enter.
    3. Type 'java Ledger' and enter.
